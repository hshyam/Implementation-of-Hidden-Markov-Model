Implemented the hidden markov model and tested the code on the toy samples that were provided. Then, I used the implemented Viterbi algorithm to analyze the provided DNS sequences to find the CpG islands with length of at least 200 base pairs. Then, I identified the down-stream genes that followed the CpG islands that had starting base pairs within 500. All other applicable comments are written in the code.
